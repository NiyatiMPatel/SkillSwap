- Automatic error handling and touched state tracking
- Field-level and form-level validation
- ~60 lines of manual validation replaced with ~20 lines of schema

### Sidebar Architecture
- Always rendered when authenticated (no conditional unmounting)
- Visibility controlled by CSS transforms
- Mobile: `translate-x-0` / `-translate-x-full`
- Desktop: Always `translate-x-0`
- Smart navigation: detects screen size before closing

### Error Handling Flow
1. User submits invalid credentials
2. Backend returns 401
3. Axios interceptor checks if on sign-in page
4. Error passed to form (no redirect)
5. Form displays error message persistently
6. User can retry without page refresh
